Salt Forge
==========

*This is very much still in early development*

- Provides a quick and easy way to create new local salt environments for development.

- Minimal dependies, python and git. Forge expects you to have python and git
  installed. All other depnencies can be bootstraped by forge itself. Forge
  won't touch the 'system python', it creates an internal virtual environment
  for the depenencies needed.
